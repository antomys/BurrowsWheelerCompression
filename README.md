## Compression Algorithms
This repository contains library of implemented compression algorithms, some demo projects to show their work.

## Implementation plan:
- [X] Implement standard Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm
- [x] Implement standard Huffman algorithm
- [x] Implement standard Burrows-Wheeler transormation 
    - [x] Implement custom query
    - [x] Implement Suffix Array 
- [x] Implement Move-To-Front (MTF) algorithm
- [x] Implement Run-Length-Encoding (RLE) algorithm
- [x] Modify Lzw with Bwt without anything else
- [x] Modify Huffman with Bwt withoud anything else
- [x] Develop and implement custom Bwt + Mtf + Lzw algorithm
- [x] Develop and implement custom Bwt + Mtf + Huffman algorithm


## Demo implementation plan:
- [x] Add demo projects
- [x] Add statistics
